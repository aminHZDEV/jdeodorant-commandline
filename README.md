This is an Eclipse plug-in that allows running [JDeodorant](https://github.com/tsantalis/JDeodorant) for identifying refactoring opportunities and applying them in the batch mode.

# Running the headless mode within Eclipse
You can run this application from within Eclipse. Please follow these steps:

1. Download (or clone) jdeodorant-commandline and [JDeodorant](https://github.com/tsantalis/JDeodorant) plug-in and import them as existing projects into your Eclipse workspace.

2. Right-click on the *JDeodorant-Commandline* project and select *Run As* > *Run Configurations...*

3. Click on *Eclipse Application* and then on the *New launch configuration* button. Give a name to the newly-created launch configuration.

4. In the *Main* tab:
    * In the *Workspace Data*, setup the *Location* to point to the workspace containing the projects that you want to analyze in the headless mode.
	The projects which are going to be analyzed will be opened in this workspace. 
	There are two options to open Java projects (that you are going to analyze) in the workspace:
		- The workspace directory is created by Eclipse. In this case, it can be created by clicking on *File* > *Switch Workspace* and specifying a new workspace directory, and then creating a new project (or importing the existing one) to Eclipse.
    You can import multiple projects that you want to analyze.
		After you are done, you should switch back to the original workspace where JDeodorant and jdeodorant-commandline plug-ins are imported.
		- You can ask the tool to try importing an existing Eclipse project automatically. In this case, the workspace is created in the given path by the tool, and the project is imported to it. You'll need to use the `-pd` switch to specify the path to the `.project` file of the project (See the table below).
	
        Note that, in any case, Eclipse project files should exist for the Java project that you want to analyze.
	* In the *Program to Run* select to *Run an application* and from the drop-down list select `jdeodorant.eclipse.commandline.application`.

5. In the *Arguments* tab specify the *Program arguments* (refer to the following table).

6. Next, specify the *VM arguments* as `-Xms128m -Xmx4096m -XX:PermSize=128m` (you can increase the Xmx value, if more memory is available).

7. In the *Plug-ins* tab first select *plug-ins selected below only* in the *Launch with:* drop-down list. Then select `jdeodorant.eclipse.commandline (1.0.0.qualifier)` and click on *Add Required Plug-ins* button.

8. Apply the changes in order to save the new Launch Configuration.
Click *Run* to test whether the headless plug-in works properly. If you are getting `BundleException`s, go back to the *Plug-ins* tab (step 7) and select *Launch with*: *all workspace and enabled target plug-ins*. Apply the changes and Run again the headless plug-in.

# Running as a standalone command-line application 

We have provided the necessary means for generating an **Eclipse product** that can be run from the OS command-line as a standalone executable, without the need for opening Eclipse for running. This is particularly useful if, for instance, one needs to integrate JDeodorant in their current development workflow (e.g., using continuous integration). 

The Eclipse product is an executable file along with the necessary plug-in dependencies. The entire package can be generated by Eclipse, one for each platform. We have tested the product on Windows and Mac. 

To generate the executable for your target platform, follow these steps:

  1. Download (or clone) jdeodorant-commandline and [JDeodorant](https://github.com/tsantalis/JDeodorant) plug-in and import them as existing projects into your Eclipse workspace
  (You will need Eclipse only to generate the Eclipse product, which runs from the OS commandline).

  2. In the commandline project, double click on `ProductConfiguration.product`. The *Product Configuration Editor* should be opened (If not, you might be missing necessary plug-ins installed on your Eclipse. We tested on *Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers*).

  3. If you need to configure the generated product, you can use the *Configuration* and *Launching* tabs, which allow changing parameters for the generated product for different platforms. For instance, you might want to change the `eclipse.ini` file that the target product will use, or provide additional VM arguments.

  4. From the *Overview* tab, under the *Exporting* section, choose *Eclipse Product Export Wizard*.

  5. In the shown wizard, `/JDeodorant-Commandline/ProductConfiguration.product` should be selected as *Configuration*. Specify a directory under the *Destination* section, and click *Finish*.

  6. A folder containing the final Eclipse Product will be created. Look for the file `\eclipse\eclipse.exe` or `\MacOS\eclipse`, which is the executable for the product.

  7. Open a command line, switch to the folder containing the executable file (found in the previous step) and run the product's executable. You should provide necessary arguments, as mentioned in the following table. For instance, you can run (on Windows):

  ```
  eclipse.exe -pd "TestProject/.project" -x "clones.xls" -m PARSE_AND_ANALYZE ...
  ```

# Command-line arguments

These arguments can be passed in step 5 (headless mode within Eclipse) or step 7 (standalone mode).

**Note:** The **bold-faced** options are mandatory. *Italic* arguments are default values.

## Mode of Operation
The headless application works in three different modes.
These modes are explained in the following table.
For running the tool in each of these modes, use appropriate value for `--mode` (or `-m`) argument.

|Value for `--mode` argument|Description|
|---|---|
|`PARSE`|In this mode, the output file of a clone detection tool will be parsed to an Excel file. You mist give the path to the Excel file using `-excelfile` (or `-x`) argument. You must also provide the name of the clone detection tool (using the `--tool` argument), the path to the input file (the output of clone detection tool, using `-i` argument), and for some specific clone detection tools, extra argument (using `--xargs`). See below for more info.|
|`ANALYZE_EXISTING`|In this mode, the tool analyzes an existing Excel file. Again, the path to the Excel file must be given using `-excelfile` (or `-x`) argument. The results of the analysis will be written in the same folder as the input Excel file.|
|`PARSE_AND_ANALYZE`|This mode first parses the output of the clone detection tool, and then analyzes the parsed Excel file. All the arguments in the `PARSE` mode must be also provided in this mode.|

# The input (and output) Excel files

The input Excel file must be in Excel 97-2003 (.xls) format.
Please note  that, the  tool cannot handle .xlsx files.
The first row of the Excel file is used as header row.
For the analysis, the input Excel file must contain the information for some of the columns,
while for other columns, the cells will be filled during the analysis.

In the Excel file, each row is for one *clone*.
Each clone is a code fragment which is detected to be duplicated in another part
of the system. Several clones in the consecutive rows belong to one *clone group*.
Hence, each possible pair of clones inside a clone group are code fragments
that are duplicated.
The row corresponding to the first clone of every clone group
contains some information about the clone group, including values for
Clone Group Size, Clone Group Info and Connected columns.

|Column|Description|
|----|----|
|Clone Group ID|An integer assigned to every *clone group*. For all the clones inside one clone group, the value of this cell is similar, which is the ID of the clone group to which these clones belong.|
|Source Folder|The source folder of the class file to which this clone belongs.|
|Package|Fully qualified path to the package of the class file to which this clone belongs.|
|Class|Name of the class file to which this clone belongs.|
|Method|Name of the method in which this clone exists. Please note that, currently there is no support for the clones outside of the boundaries of methods.|
|Method Signature|Signature of the method in which this clone exists, in the Bytecode format.|
|Start Line, End Line, Start Offset, End Offset|Starting and ending lines and offsets of the clone fragment.|
|#PDG Nodes|Number of PDG nodes in the method in which this clone exists. This column will be filled after analysis on this clone is done.|
|#Statements|Number of statements in the clone fragment that is reported to be a clone. This column will be filled after analysis on this clone is done.|
|Line coverage|Percentage of the number of lines of code fragment covered by unit tests.|
|Clone Group Size|Number of the clones in the clone group. This value only comes in the first row of the clone group.|
|Clone Group Info|Type of the clone group. It might be *Repeated* when the entire clone group is repeated, or *Subclone* when the clones in this clone group are sub-clones or super-clones of clones in another clone group. In these two cases, our tool will skip the clone group for analysis.|
|Connected|If the value of the previous cell is **Subclone**, this cell contains the clone group ID of the clone group of which this clone group is a sub-clone (or super-clone).|
|Clone Pair Location|Location of the clones in the clone group. Clones could be in the same in the same method, in the same class, or in different classes.|
|#Refactorable Pairs|Number of refactorable pairs in the clone group, which is calculated after the analysis.|
|Details| Each pair of clones in every clone group is analyzed by the tool. When the analysis finished, in this column, and the following columns in the same row, hyperlinks to the HTML reports of the analysis of the clone pair corresponding to this row and all other clones in the same clone group are given. The name of the hyperlink is in the format `{clone group ID}-{first clone number}-{second clone number}`.<br /> If the background color for a cell is <code style="background-color: #7FFF00">green</code>, it means that the clone pair corresponding to this cell is refactorable, if it is <code style="background-color: red; color: black">red</code>, it means that the clone pair is not refactorable. A <code style="background-color: white">white</code> background color shows that the clone is not analyzed. This happens when: <ul><li>A clone is a *class-level* clone, meaning that the clone that is reported by the clone detection tool goes beyond the boundaries of a method, or</li><li>A clone is a repeated clone, or</li><li>User has marked the clone group corresponding to this clone to be skipped (using `-skip-groups` (`-s`), or</li><li>No method was found in the given code region that was reported by the clone detection tool, or</li><li>No common nesting structure was found for the clone pair.</li></ul>|

A sample empty Excel file is provided [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsantalis/jdeodorant-commandline/master/plugin.xmlsample.xls).


# Using the output of clone detection tools

The output of a clone detection tool must be first converted to the desired Excel file.
For convenience, we have provided parsers for the popular clone detection tools, as an internal feature in the command-line tool.

When the tool is executed in the `PARSE` or `PARSE_AND_ANALYZE` modes, user has to provide the tool with the output file of the clone detection tool, using `--tooloutputfile` (`-i`) argument.
Also, the name of the clone detector must be specified using `--tool` (`-t`) argument.
For example, the following arguments can be used to parse and analyze an output from CCFinder for project Apache Ant:

```
-p apache-ant-1.7.0
-x "apache-ant-1.7.0-ccfinder.xls"
-m PARSE_AND_ANALYZE
-t CLONE_TOOL_CCFINDER
-i "ccfinder.ccfxd"
-xargs "C:\Results\CCFinder\apache-ant-1.7.0\src\.ccfxprepdir",""
-testsrcs "src/tests/junit"
```

For the moment the tool supports five different clone detection tools, as shown in the table below.
The value for `--extra-args` (`-xargs`) argument depends on the tool, and provides necessary information for parsing the input file.
For instance, in this example we have provided two additional strings through this argument, separated by comma.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Clone Detection Tool</th>
      <th><code>--tool</code> (<code>-t</code>)</th>
      <th><code>--extra-args-</code> (<code>-xargs</code>)</th>

            Path to the special folder that CCFinder generates during analysis (named <code>ccfinder.ccfxd</code>).
            This folder is located in the examined directory.
          </li>
          <li>[optional] Path to the src folder of the project.</li>

# Output of the commandline tool

The commandline tool generates an Excel file, with the same name (appended by `-analyze`) and in the same path as the input Excel file which contains the results of the analysis.
The HTML reports of the analysis can be found in a folder named `html.reports` which is located in the same folder as the input and output Excel files.

When the tool is used to parse the output of a clone detection tool, a folder named `code-fragments` in the same path as the input and output Excel files is created,
which contains the real code fragments as reported by the clone detection tool.
The names of these files are in the format `{ID}-{CLONE_NUMBER}`, where `{ID}' is the ID of the corresponding clone group to which this clone belongs,
and `{CLONE_NUMBER}` is the clone's index in current clone group. This helps in mapping Excel file rows (clones) to these files.

For those who are interested in performing statistical analysis using tools such as R, Matlab, etc, the tool generates CSV files containing information gathered during analysis.
Three CSV files are created, as explaned below.
Please note that, the separator in these files is pipe ("|") character.
The first row of these files is header.

## {INPUT_EXCEL_FILE_NAME}.report.csv

Contains general information about the refactorability analysis results.
Every row in these files corresponds to a single clone *pair*.
The columns in the order they appear in the CSV files are:

between the clone pairs for each <b>subtree</b>; i.e., the differences
which lead to lambda expressions that has a single expression as its body.
The file has the following columns:

## {INPUT_EXCEL_FILE_NAME}.blockgapsinfo.csv
This file contains, for each *subtree*, information about the block gaps,
i.e., the gaps for which JDeodorant has to make lambda expressions with
a block of statements as their body.
The file has the same columns as {INPUT_EXCEL_FILE_NAME}.exprgapsinfo.csv;
in addition, it contains two additional columns, namely `#Statements1` and `#Statements2`, which include the number of statements inside the body of the created lambda expressions for the first and second clone pairs, respectively.
